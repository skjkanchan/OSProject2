a. This is my first addition to the devlog. This project seems like it will be more complex than the first as it uses multithreading and semiphores. I have worked with these concepts a little before in my UNIX class, however not very deeply. Additionally, that was using C but I plan on using Java for this project as I am more familiar with it. 
b. This session I plan on importing the sample code from elearning and trying to just understand how it works. I will also setup my github repo and push this devlog. Additionally, I intend to add the file for this project.
