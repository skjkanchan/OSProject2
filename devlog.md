a. This is my first addition to the devlog. This project seems like it will be more complex than the first as it uses multithreading and semiphores. I have worked with these concepts a little before in my UNIX class, however not very deeply. Additionally, that was using C but I plan on using Java for this project as I am more familiar with it. 
b. This session I plan on importing the sample code from elearning and trying to just understand how it works. I will also setup my github repo and push this devlog. Additionally, I intend to add the file for this project.

I am now ending this project session. I added all the sample code and looked into it more to understand how it works. I also finished making my github repo and cloning it and I pushed this devlog. I also created the Bank.java file for the project. I was able to accomplish everything I intended. Next session I plan on looking at Project Overview video again and then beginning the code for the project.

a. I am starting a new project session. After watching the Project 2 overview video again and looking through the sample code I understand the project better. We have different threads, some of the Teller class and some of the Customer class. We are going to use signals to tell customers when the teller is ready. This is possibly using semaphores the way SignalDemo did but some comments said the project has too many threads for that so I will have to look more into that. 
b. This session I plan on creating some Tellers and some Customers and just working on the communication there.

I am now ending this project session. I created the Teller and Customer Class and the Transaction Types. Now Threads can start running for both, and the program is randomly choosing a transaction type. Next session I plan on integrating the semaphores to start communication between tellers and customers.

a. I am starting a new project session. Since last project session I have learned how semaphores will act as signals throughout the program to let tellers and customers know when they are ready.
b. This session I plan on working on the communication between the tellers and the customers and getting the line function for customers seeing tellers to be functional.
